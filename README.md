# MatrixCalculator

This is a simple calculator program that I made to speed up calculations in my linear algebra course. Thie <b>matrixOp.py</b> file is the original file I made for the class. Because of a number of design problems in the original file, the new updated version runs from <b>main.py</b>. While the original file only prompts the user for input until completion, the new version uses a command line interface with certain commands. Matrices that are saved to .txt files can be loaded, multiplied, added, and exponentiated.

The three main focuses in the process of creating this were the following. First, I wanted to strengthen my Python programming skills. Secondly, I used my knowledge of bitwise operations and problem solving skills to optimize the algorithms. Thirdly, I wanted to excersize design decisions for the command line framework so that expanding the functionality of this interface could be made easier.
